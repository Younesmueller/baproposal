\section{Planning of the Proposal}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Read the 4 Proposals and get an Idea of what is required in the Proposals
    \item write down as much as possible
    \item ist es sinnvoll zuererst zu lesen, was RE ist, oder zuerst die apps anschauen?
    \item look at the current implementation of the app and other bike-rental systems
    \item look in the App-Store and read ratings to get an idea, what is wrong or good 
    \item Get an Idea of Requirements engeineering and what problems could arise    
\end{itemize}


\section{Gedanken}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Wie eng ist die Zusammenarbeit mit BA-Betreuer?
    \item the Introduction contains some kind of problem description
    \item Things that bother users
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Broken bikes
        \item no near stations
        \item bad support
        \item cumbersome use of the app        
    \end{itemize}
    \item app provides several services
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item station and bike information
        \item Bike rental
        \item support
        \item contract information
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{Einleitung}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Relevance of biketraffic for environment and quality of life in cities
    \item health benefits
    \item justification for a electric bike rental System
    \item geographical Situation
    \item can't motivate people to use conventional bikes
    \item limitations of electric bikes (recharging of batteries)
    \item stations have to contain bikes/have space for bike
    \item there have to be enough stations
    \item users want to have information on:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Position of stations
        \item Number of bikes
        \item Charging status of the bikes
    \end{itemize}
    \item Users want to have these information:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item On the fly
        \item spontaneusly
    \end{itemize}
    \item for this purpose a mobile app is ideal
    \item A modern company is expected to have a modern app
    \item in order for the app to be future-proof it is necessary to analyse possible Requirements
    \item \textbf{The goal of this work is to analyse the requirements that are placed on such a mobile app.}
    \item Registration is bad \todo{Make the registration simpler}
\end{itemize}
